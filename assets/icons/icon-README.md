# Icon Files Required

You need to create two icon files for the PWA to work properly:

## Required Icons

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels

## How to Create Icons

### Option 1: Use Online Tools
- Visit https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Upload your logo/icon
- Generate all required sizes
- Download the 192x192 and 512x512 versions

### Option 2: Use Image Editing Software
1. Create or find your icon/logo
2. Resize to 192x192 pixels (save as icon-192.png)
3. Resize to 512x512 pixels (save as icon-512.png)
4. Place both files in this `assets/icons/` folder

### Option 3: Use a Simple Design Tool
- Use Canva, Figma, or similar tools
- Create a square canvas (192x192 or 512x512)
- Design your icon
- Export as PNG
- Save with the correct filename

## Icon Design Tips

- Use simple, recognizable designs
- Ensure good contrast for visibility
- Test on both light and dark backgrounds
- Use your brand colors if applicable
- Keep text minimal (icons are small)

## Temporary Solution

For testing, you can use any square PNG images renamed to:
- `icon-192.png`
- `icon-512.png`

The app will work without proper icons, but PWA installation may be limited.
